- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Patricia (@Code-Patis). I'm a beginner and although sometimes I feel a bit overwhelmed for all the things I yet have to learn, I'm enjoying it. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything that has do to with the front-end side, although I don't mind also learning some of the back-end side.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of HTML and CSS and of course, I also want to learn JavaScript and Python.
