- 👋 Hi, I’m Patricia (@Code-Patis). I'm a beginner and although sometimes I feel a bit overwhelmed for all the things I still have to learn, I'm enjoying it. 
- 👀 I’m interested in everything that has do to with the front-end side, although I don't mind also learning some of the back-end side.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of HTML and CSS and of course, I also want to learn JavaScript and Python.
